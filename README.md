# cnoidal

*Cnoidal* is a Haskell library for representing, transforming, and live coding music.

It is based on the notion of *temporal media*, a data type that represents a collection of time intervals tagged with values. It supports various functor instances, like Applicative Functor, which are highly useful for live coding.

A first version of the library is presented at the [FARM 2019][farm2019] workshop [at the ICFP 2019 in Berlin][berlin].
